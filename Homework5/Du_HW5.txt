1. Which of the followings is considered boxing?

a. double dblx = fx;
b. float fx = ix;
c. object myobjx = fx;
d. int ix = objy;

- my answer is c.

2. Which of the followings is considered unboxing?

a. string str = ix.ToString();
b. double dblx =(double) fx;
c. object myobjx = fx;
d. int ix = (int) objy;

- my answer is d.

3. Object objdblx is of type double. Assign the value of this object to a variable of type float.

float fx = (float)(double)objdblx;

4. Object objflx is of type float. Assign the value of this object o another variable of type double.

double dx = (double)(float)objflx;

5. Convert the string strx to a double dblx:

double dblx = Convert.ToDouble(strx);    or  (double)strx;

6. Convert the integer ix to a float fx:

float fx = Convert.ToSingle(ix);     or  (float)ix;

7. Convert the double dblx to a string strx:

string strx = Convert.ToString(dblx);     or (string)dblx;

8. Object is the   base   class of all other data types.

9. What is an object (the definition)?

- An object is a block of memory that has been allocated according to the blueprint. 
An object is like a box so that it can contain any kinds of data type even if in an array or collection, 
and a program may create multiple objects in same class. 

10. How do you declare an object in C#?

What is the difference between an object and a variable?

- Object can be declared by  object myObj = something;   
However, name of object can be anything if we want like Dog mydog = new Dog();
A variable is like a piece of a paper so it only has one value with it but we can erase and write another value on it. 
However, an object is like a box so we can put many variables in the same object.
